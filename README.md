# TTRP (Truck and Trailer Problem)

> A tabu search method for the TTRP.

In the truck and trailer routing problems (TTRPs) a fleet of trucks and trailers serves a set of customers.
Some customers with accessibility constraints must be served just by truck, while others can be served
either by truck or by a complete vehicle (a truck pulling a trailer). This problem originally introduced by Chao, it's a variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP).

Note: Cplex needed.
